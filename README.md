# BuildPulse Example Project: Ruby + RSpec

This is an example [RSpec](https://rspec.info/) project demonstrating how to send test results to [BuildPulse](https://buildpulse.io) to help you detect, track, and eliminate flaky tests.

## GitHub Actions CI Integration

If you have an existing RSpec project building on [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), this [diff](https://github.com/Workshop64/buildpulse-example-rspec/compare/7d2004e...github-actions) shows how to set up your GitHub Actions workflow to send test results to BuildPulse.

## Semaphore CI Integration

If you have an existing RSpec project building on [Semaphore](https://semaphoreci.com/), this [diff](https://github.com/Workshop64/buildpulse-example-rspec/compare/7d2004e...semaphore) shows how to set up your `.semaphore/semaphore.yml` workflow to send test results to BuildPulse.
